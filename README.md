# Elementor CSS Regeneration Log

Essentially, when activated, the plugin will automatically regenerate files and data from Elementor, providing us with access to a fresh version of files when working on or updating any post without CSS issues.

Furthermore, with this plugin, you will have the ability to view the most recent logs of successful CSS regeneration in the WordPress backend.

The log will display the latest 50 entries, ordered by date and the user who edited the page. The log file is located within the plugin directory and will automatically purge when the 51st entry is saved.

Feel free to download and install the plugin in any environment (it is safe to use).

If you encounter any inconsistencies, please remember to clear the WPEngine cache!
